FERTILIZER RESEARCH PROMPT

Research the fertilizer "[[FERTILIZER_NAME]]" and generate comprehensive data in JSON format for a garden database. Include detailed information about the fertilizer itself, its composition, application methods, and suitable plants.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a single JSON array containing detailed fertilizer objects. The JSON should be properly formatted and ready for direct import into a database.

GUIDELINES:

1. FERTILIZER DETAILS:
   - Research [[FERTILIZER_NAME]] thoroughly and provide comprehensive information
   - Include accurate NPK ratio and percentages of each nutrient
   - If it's a specific brand, include manufacturer information
   - If it's a generic type (like "fish emulsion"), focus on typical composition

2. NUTRIENT CONTENT:
   - Provide accurate percentages for primary nutrients (N-P-K)
   - Include information about micronutrients when available
   - For organic fertilizers, describe the source materials

3. APPLICATION:
   - Include detailed application methods and rates
   - Specify which plants benefit most from this fertilizer
   - Note any seasonal considerations for application

4. PRACTICAL INFORMATION:
   - Include storage requirements and shelf life
   - Note any safety precautions or environmental concerns
   - Provide information about cost and availability

5. FORMATTING:
   - Ensure all JSON is properly formatted with correct syntax
   - Use decimal numbers for percentages (e.g., 5.0 not "5%")
   - For unknown values, use null instead of empty strings
   - Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON array

Your response should be a single, valid JSON array that can be directly imported into our garden database.
