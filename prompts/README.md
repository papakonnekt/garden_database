# AI Data Generation Prompts

This directory contains prompt templates designed to be used with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Claude to generate structured data for the Garden Database.

## Purpose

The goal of these prompts is to leverage AI capabilities to research various horticultural topics (plants, diseases, pests, fertilizers, etc.) and format the information into specific JSON structures suitable for bulk import into the database via the application's bulk import feature.

## How to Use

1.  **Select a Prompt:** Choose the prompt file corresponding to the type of data you want to generate (e.g., `plant_research_prompt.txt` for plant data, `disease_research_prompt.txt` for disease data).
2.  **Fill in Placeholders:** If the prompt contains placeholders (like `[[PLANT_NAME]]`), replace them with the specific item you want to research.
3.  **Submit to AI:** Copy the entire prompt content and submit it to your chosen LLM.
4.  **Validate Output:** Review the JSON output generated by the AI to ensure it is correctly formatted according to the prompt's specifications and that the information is accurate.
5.  **Import Data:** Save the validated JSON output to a file and use the Garden Database application's bulk import feature (usually found at `/bulk-import/` on the web interface) to load the data.

## Available Prompts

*   **`plant_research_prompt.txt`:** Generates data for a specific plant, its companions, and common pests.
*   **`disease_research_prompt.txt`:** Generates data for common plant diseases.
*   **`pest_research_prompt.txt`:** Generates data for common garden pests.
*   **`fertilizer_research_prompt.txt`:** Generates data for different types of fertilizers.
*   **`companion_plant_research_prompt.txt`:** Focuses specifically on companion planting interactions.
*   **`region_research_prompt.txt`:** Generates data for specific growing regions/zones.
*   **`seed_research_prompt.txt`:** Generates data for specific seed varieties.
*   **`soil_profile_research_prompt.txt`:** Generates data for different soil profiles.

These prompts provide a structured way to populate the Garden Database with comprehensive information using AI assistance.
