PLANT RESEARCH PROMPT

Research the plant "[[PLANT_NAME]]" and generate comprehensive data in JSON format for a garden database. Include detailed information about the plant itself, its companion planting relationships, and common pests that affect it.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a single JSON object with three main sections: plants, companion_relationships, and pests. The JSON should be properly formatted and ready for direct import into a database.

GUIDELINES:

1. PRIMARY PLANT:
   - Make [[PLANT_NAME]] the first entry in the "plants" array with comprehensive details
   - Include at least 15 fields for the primary plant
   - Use accurate botanical information and growing requirements

2. COMPANION PLANTS:
   - Include both beneficial and detrimental companion plants
   - For companion plants, provide basic information (common_name, scientific_name, family, etc.)
   - Each companion plant should have its own entry in the "plants" array

3. RELATIONSHIPS:
   - In the "companion_relationships" array, document how [[PLANT_NAME]] interacts with each companion
   - For each relationship, [[PLANT_NAME]] should be the "plant_subject" and the companion the "plant_object"
   - Explain the mechanism of interaction (e.g., "repels pests", "fixes nitrogen")

4. PESTS:
   - Include 3-5 common pests that affect [[PLANT_NAME]]
   - For each pest, include the scientific_name of [[PLANT_NAME]] in the "affected_plants" array
   - If a pest also affects companion plants, include those scientific names too

5. FORMATTING:
   - Use proper botanical naming conventions for scientific names (Genus species)
   - For code fields, use ONLY the specified codes (e.g., "AN" for Annual)
   - Ensure all JSON is properly formatted with correct syntax
   - Do not include any explanatory text outside the JSON object

Your response should be a single, valid JSON object that can be directly imported into our garden database.
