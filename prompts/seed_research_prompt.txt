Generate a detailed dataset for a wide variety of plant seeds, covering vegetables, fruits, herbs, and flowers. For each specific plant seed type, provide the following information in a structured JSON format:
- Common Plant Name: (string) The common name of the plant the seed belongs to.
- Scientific Name: (string) The scientific binomial name of the plant.
- Variety Name: (string, optional) Specific cultivar or variety name, if applicable.
- Seed Description: (string) Physical characteristics (size, shape, color, texture).
- Optimal Germination Temperature Range: (string) The ideal soil temperature range for germination (specify units, e.g., 째C/째F).
- Germination Time: (string) Typical number of days required for seeds to sprout under optimal conditions.
- Soil Temperature Requirement for Sowing: (string) Minimum or optimal soil temperature needed before sowing outdoors (specify units, e.g., 째C/째F).
- Sowing Depth: (string) Recommended depth to plant the seed (e.g., 1/4 inch, 6mm).
- Spacing Requirements: (object)
    - Plant Spacing: (string) Recommended distance between individual plants.
    - Row Spacing: (string) Recommended distance between rows.
- Light Requirements for Germination: (string) Specify if light is required, beneficial, or inhibitory for germination (e.g., "Requires light", "Requires darkness", "Light aids germination").
- Seed Viability Duration: (string) Estimated number of years the seed typically remains viable under proper storage conditions.
- Pre-treatment Needs: (object)
    - Stratification: (string) Describe any required cold, moist stratification period (duration, temperature). Use "None" if not needed.
    - Scarification: (string) Describe any required seed coat abrasion or weakening method (e.g., nicking, soaking in hot water). Use "None" if not needed.
- Days to Maturity: (string) Typical number of days from sowing/transplanting to harvest or first flowering.
