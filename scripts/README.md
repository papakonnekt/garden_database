# Utility Scripts

This directory is intended to hold utility scripts for the Garden Database project, such as maintenance tasks, data processing helpers, or other automation tools.

**Note:** The primary setup scripts for initializing the development environment (`setup.sh` for Linux/macOS and `setup.bat` for Windows) are currently located in the project's root directory (`../`). These scripts handle Docker checks, container building/starting, and opening the application in the browser. Refer to `../docs/SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.
